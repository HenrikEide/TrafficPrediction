Recap of thesis work thus far.

Tentative title:
Explainable AI for text classification. (Maybe LLM)

Description:
Apply and evaluate XAI methods to a LLM fine-tuned on text classification tasks. 

If the explainee is a data scientist working on the model being explained, we may possibly provide methods for "closing the loop"; providing the scientist a way to influence the trained parameters of the model in the correct direction. Given an explaination that reveals inaccuracies in the model.


Equinor project specifics:

Equinor has fine-tuned a BERT_large model from Nasjonalbiblioteket AI Lab trained on Norwegian text. (https://huggingface.co/NbAiLab/nb-bert-large).
